# Vite 6.x

An example configuration is found in the `vite.config.js` file.  

This handles reading a local ssl file (from Mkcert), handles TailwindCSS and Laravel.

Example but not limited to what's in package.json.

Note the `my-project.test` entry in the `vite.config.js` file. This should be replaced with your domain.
