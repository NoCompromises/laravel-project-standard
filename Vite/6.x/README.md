# Vite 6.x

An example configuration is found in the `vite.config.js` file.  

This handles reading a local ssl file (from Mkcert), handles TailwindCSS and Laravel.

Example but not limited to: 

```json
{
    devDependencies: {
        "@tailwindcss/vite": "^4.1.11",
        "laravel-vite-plugin": "^1.3.0",
        "tailwindcss": "^4.1.11",
        "vite": "^6.3.5"
    }
}
```

Note the `my-project.test` entry in the `vite.config.js` file. This should be replaced with your domain.
